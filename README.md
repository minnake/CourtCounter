# Court Counter

Score Keeper App 

Project Overview 

This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app that allows a user to keep track of points within a game. 

The goal is to create an Score Keeper app which gives a user the ability to keep track of the score of two different teams playing a game of your choice. To build this project, you can follow along with the practice set and customize the Court Counter app to track scores from a different sport. 

Why this project? 

In the most recent portion of the Nanodegree program, you learned how to make use of Java in your Android apps to make them interactive. With Score Keeper, you will be practicing this skill set, with particular focus on button code, variable scope, and updating views. 

What will I learn? 

This project is about combining various ideas and skills weâ€™ve been practicing throughout the course. They include: 

* Adding button code to your app 
* Updating views 
* Properly scoping variables 
* Finding views by their ID 

Note: As the focus of this program is Java, only projects completed with Java as the source code will be accepted. Projects using Kotlin as the source code will not be accepted. 

Build Your Project 

To complete this project, you will need to build a Score Keeper app. You can either start from scratch, or customize the Court Counter app you made as part of Practice set 2. 

In either case, you will need to select a sport or game to track. Importantly, you'll need to select a sport with either multiple ways to score points or multiple metrics to track. If you have trouble choosing, here are some suggestions: 

* Baseball Scores App: Track both runs and outs 
* American Football Scores App: Add a button for each of the 4 amounts of points a team can score in american football. 
* Football Scores app: Track both points and fouls
